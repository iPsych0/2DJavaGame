## **1.5: Gameplay (controls)**

> **Note:** All in-game keys can be re-bound to the player's preference.
The mouse however is not customizable. The following paragraphs indicate the default key binds.

**The player character uses WASD movement keys to walk around. For combat actions and interaction with user interfaces, the mouse is used.**

**By hovering the mouse over objects or NPCs, a target lock and a tooltip will show at the top of the screen. This indicates that an object or NPC may be interacted with. There are three colors for this lock:**

**1. Green lock:** Item on the floor
**2. Yellow lock:** NPC or world object that may be interacted with
**3. Red lock:** Attackable enemies

>**Note: If no target lock or tooltip shows up when hovering over an object, this means you cannot interact with it.**

**The right-mouse button is primarily used to interact with items. By right-clicking, the player may pick up an item when standing on it, equip/unequip an item, add/remove items from a user interface.**

**Spacebar is used to interact with objects or NPCs in Myrinnia. While interacting, the player may be presented with some dialogue and/or choices to advance a dialogue.**

**The left-mouse button is primarily used for attacking or aiming abilities but is also used to drag (and drop) items and to perform actions in user interfaces. It is also used to select which item(s) the player wishes to buy/sell in a shop.**

**By default, the interfaces that are open are the ‘Chat Window’, ‘Inventory & Equipment’, ‘HP Overlay’ and the 'Ability HUD'. All interfaces but the HP overlay and ability HUD can be toggled off to give the player a better view. The following shortcuts can be used:**

> **C: Chat**
