# **1: Game Information**

## **1.1: Introduction**

**This is a game design document for the game Elements of Myrinnia. This document will provide an insight into the context of the game, as well as the gameplay, story, game design and technical choices.**

**Finally, chapter 3 will review the technical design choices for Elements of Myrinnia. In specific, the engine that is used to create the world of Myrinnia, the graphical design and the sound design.**

## **1.2: Theme**

**The story of Myrinnia explores two major themes. Lust for power and a ‘hero’s journey’-narrative.**

## **1.3: Setting**

**Elements of Myrinnia is set in a medieval fantasy world, where magic is commonplace. The aptitude of magic comes from the four primordial spirits Luna (air), Fyra (fire), Terra (earth) and Seyla (water), whom together shaped the world of Myrinnia with their divine magical powers. The remnants of magic that linger in Myrinnia lets its inhabitants channel some of this magic and use it.**

## **1.4: Genre**

**Elements of Myrinnia is a 2D, Top-Down Action RPG where the player character explores a fantasy world filled with magic through combat, quests and skills. Elements of Myrinnia has drawn inspiration from games such as RuneScape, Guild Wars and the TV series Avatar: The Last Airbender and blends it into a unique 2D adventure-like open world experience.**

## **1.5: Gameplay (controls)**

**The player character uses WASD movement keys to walk around. For combat and interaction with user interfaces, the mouse is used.**

**The left-mouse button is primarily used for attacking but is also used to drag items and to click in user interfaces. It is also used to select which item(s) the player wishes to buy/sell in a shop.**

**The right-mouse button is used to interact primarily with items. By right-clicking, the player may pick up an item when standing on it, equip/unequip an item, add/remove items from a user interface.**

**By hovering the mouse over objects or NPCs, a tooltip will display at the top of the screen. This indicates that an object or NPC may be interacted with. If no tooltip shows up when hovering over an object, this means you cannot interact with it.**

**Spacebar is used to interact with objects or NPCs in Myrinnia. While interacting, the player may be presented with some dialogue and/or choices to advance a dialogue.**

**By default, the interfaces that are open are the ‘Chat Window’, ‘Inventory & Equipment’, ‘HP Overlay’ and the 'Ability HUD'. All interfaces but the HP overlay and ability HUD can be toggled off to give the player a better view. The following shortcuts can be used:**

> **C: Chat**
> 
> **I: Inventory & Equipment**
> 
> **M: World map**
>  
> **K: Character screen**
> 
> **L: Skills interface**
> 
> **Q: Quests interface**
>
> **B: Abilities interface**

**Finally, the game is rendered through an orthographic camera.**
