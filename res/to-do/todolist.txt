=== Main Story ===
Rifts to other dimensions (Underworld). Accessible from the overworld.
 
Some rifts require certain levels or skills to go through (as you will need them in the rift). Some may even require items.
Generally they require a certain combat level. Some rifts may require previous rift instances to be completed.
Some may require certain overworld/underworld quests to be completed.
 
Unlock abilities that help you progress in both the overworld and underworld (like crossing water, climbing rocks, etc).
 
Primary enemies are cultists. Cultist shamans have opened rifts to the Underworld in the Overworld. Shamans are powerful enemies and can summon powerful enemy
creatures from the Underworld.
 
Dungeoneering/Raid-like levels, repeatable, not random but instanced.
 
Ideas for name of “guild/group” of the good guys: “The Ascended”, “The Alliance”, meer ideëen?
 
Ideas for name of “the cult”: “The Abyssal Cult”, “Infernal Cult”, “The Syndicate”(Refers to a group of organised ‘crime’. maybe multiple enemy cults?), “The Legion”
 
Story ideas:
The (name) Cult performed an ancient ritual that has opened rifts to (name Underworld) across (name Overworld). The cultists are attacking the overworld from the underworld,
where they have allied with a powerful, unknown being. (A strong mage/creature from the underworld?)
 
Every “Legion” of underworld creatures and cultists is led by a Legion Commander/General (boss). Defeating these will complete an instance and progress the main story.
